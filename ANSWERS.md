# Autochek SFE Assessment - Architecture & System Design Answers

## Design Question: Structuring a Large-Scale Frontend Application

### Architecture Approach

For a large-scale frontend application with hundreds of components and multiple feature teams, I would recommend a **modular architecture** based on the following principles:

1. **Feature-based organization** - Structure the codebase around business domains/features rather than technical layers.
2. **Component-driven development** - Build from atomic components upward.
3. **Clear boundaries** - Create well-defined interfaces between different parts of the application.

### Folder Structure

```
src/
├── core/                 # Core functionality shared across the entire app
│   ├── api/              # API client, request/response handling
│   ├── auth/             # Authentication logic
│   ├── config/           # Application configuration
│   └── utils/            # Utility functions
├── features/             # Feature modules
│   ├── feature-1/        # Each feature is isolated with its own components, hooks, etc.
│   │   ├── api/
│   │   ├── components/
│   │   ├── hooks/
│   │   ├── pages/
│   │   ├── store/
│   │   └── feature-1.routes.tsx
│   └── feature-2/
│       └── ...
├── shared/               # Shared UI components and utilities
│   ├── components/       # Shared UI components
│   ├── hooks/            # Shared hooks
│   └── utils/            # Shared utility functions
├── assets/               # Static assets
├── styles/               # Global styles
└── App.tsx               # Main entry point
```

### State Management

I would implement a multi-layered state management approach:

1. **Component State** - Use React's useState/useReducer for local UI state.
2. **Feature State** - Implement feature-specific state using context or libraries.
3. **Global State** - For truly global state (auth, themes, etc.), use a global store.
4. **Server State** - Use React Query/SWR for data fetching and caching.

For a large application, I'd prefer libraries like Zustand or Redux Toolkit that support:
- Modular state design
- Dev tools for debugging
- Middleware for side effects
- Easy testing

### Code Splitting and Lazy Loading

1. **Route-based splitting** - Lazy load entire feature modules using `React.lazy()` and `Suspense`.
2. **Component-level splitting** - For large components that aren't immediately visible.
3. **Dynamic imports** - For functionality used occasionally.

Implementation:
```typescript
// In the main router
const FeatureModule = React.lazy(() => import('./features/feature-module'));

// In the routes
<Routes>
  <Route 
    path="/feature" 
    element={
      <Suspense fallback={<LoadingSpinner />}>
        <FeatureModule />
      </Suspense>
    } 
  />
</Routes>
```

### Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests** - For individual components and utility functions.
2. **Integration Tests** - For feature flows and component interaction.
3. **E2E Tests** - For critical user journeys across the application.
4. **Visual Regression Tests** - To ensure UI consistency.

Testing pyramid approach:
- Many unit tests (80%)
- Some integration tests (15%) 
- Few E2E tests (5%)

Technologies: Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress/Playwright for E2E, Storybook for component isolation.

### Scalability Considerations

1. **Monorepo with Workspaces** - Using tools like Nx, Turborepo, or Yarn/npm workspaces.
2. **Microfrontend Architecture** - For very large teams/applications, consider module federation.
3. **Design System** - Shared component library with documentation.
4. **API Abstraction** - Consistent data fetching layer.
5. **Feature Flags** - For phased rollouts and A/B testing.

## Performance Question: Diagnosing and Improving Performance

### Diagnosing Performance Issues

1. **Performance Metrics Collection**:
   - Use Lighthouse for overall performance scores
   - Implement Core Web Vitals monitoring (FCP, LCP, CLS, FID)
   - Set up Performance monitoring (Chrome DevTools, React Profiler)
   - Use application monitoring tools (New Relic, Datadog)

2. **Identifying Bottlenecks**:
   - Excessive renders (React DevTools Profiler)
   - Large component trees (React DevTools Components)
   - Network waterfall analysis (slow requests, render-blocking resources)
   - JavaScript parsing/execution time (Performance tab)
   - Memory leaks (Memory tab)

### Improving Performance

1. **Render Optimization**:
   - Implement memoization with `React.memo`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback`
   - Use virtualization for long lists (react-window, react-virtualized)
   - Implement proper keys for list items
   - Avoid inline functions in render
   - Fix unnecessary re-renders with shouldComponentUpdate or React.memo

2. **Bundle Size Reduction**:
   - Code splitting and lazy loading
   - Tree shaking and dead code elimination
   - Replace large dependencies with lighter alternatives
   - Configure webpack/bundler for optimal output
   - Use dynamic imports for conditionally used code
   - Implement module/chunk splitting strategies

3. **Resource Optimization**:
   - Optimize images (WebP format, responsive images)
   - Use font-display: swap for text visibility
   - Implement resource hints (preload, prefetch)
   - Enable compression (Brotli, Gzip)
   - Use HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 for multiplexing

4. **State Management Optimization**:
   - Normalize complex state
   - Use optimistic updates for faster UX
   - Implement selective state subscriptions
   - Avoid storing derived/computed data
   - Leverage immutable data patterns or libraries

5. **Caching and Data Fetching**:
   - Implement proper caching strategies
   - Use React Query/SWR for smart fetching
   - Implement stale-while-revalidate patterns
   - Consider GraphQL for data minimization
   - Optimize API endpoints

6. **CSS Performance**:
   - Reduce CSS specificity and complexity
   - Minimize unused CSS
   - Use CSS-in-JS with critical path extraction
   - Avoid layout thrashing with batched DOM operations
   - Use CSS containment for layout isolation

## Security Question: Common Frontend Security Pitfalls

### Common Security Vulnerabilities

1. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**:
   - **Problem**: Allowing untrusted data to be executed as code
   - **Mitigation**:
     - Use React's built-in XSS protection
     - Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)
     - Sanitize user inputs
     - Use DOMPurify for HTML rendering
     - Avoid dangerouslySetInnerHTML when possible

2. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**:
   - **Problem**: Exploiting authenticated sessions for unauthorized actions
   - **Mitigation**:
     - Implement anti-CSRF tokens
     - Use SameSite cookie attribute
     - Verify request origins
     - Use custom headers for AJAX requests

3. **Sensitive Data Exposure**:
   - **Problem**: Exposing sensitive information in client-side code
   - **Mitigation**:
     - Never store secrets in frontend code
     - Implement proper access controls
     - Use HTTPS exclusively
     - Sanitize error messages
     - Implement proper logging (avoid sensitive data)

4. **Insecure Dependencies**:
   - **Problem**: Using libraries with known vulnerabilities
   - **Mitigation**:
     - Regular dependency audits (npm audit)
     - Dependency scanning in CI pipeline
     - Update dependencies regularly
     - Pin dependency versions
     - Use lockfiles

5. **Broken Authentication**:
   - **Problem**: Weak authentication mechanisms
   - **Mitigation**:
     - Implement proper token handling
     - Use HTTP-only cookies for sensitive tokens
     - Implement proper session management
     - Support MFA where appropriate
     - Secure logout functionality

6. **Client-Side Storage Security**:
   - **Problem**: Insecure data storage in browser
   - **Mitigation**:
     - Don't store sensitive data in localStorage
     - Encrypt sensitive data when client storage is necessary
     - Clear sensitive data when no longer needed
     - Set proper cookie security attributes

### Security Best Practices

1. **Input Validation**:
   - Validate all user inputs both client and server-side
   - Implement proper type checking and validation schemas

2. Pre-commit hooks run formatting and linting
3. Developer pushes to remote
4. CI pipeline runs:
   - Type checking
   - Linting
   - Tests (unit, integration)
   - Builds the application
   - Runs security scans
   - Analyzes bundle size
5. PR created with preview deployment
6. E2E tests and performance tests on preview
7. Code review and approval
8. Merge to main branch
9. Deployment to staging
10. Final validation
11. Deployment to production

This pipeline ensures code quality, consistency, and prevents common issues before they reach production. It provides fast feedback to developers and maintains a high level of code quality across the team.
